# Pairing Project No. 1

## What is a Pairing Project?

In software development, the word 'pair' is short for 'pair programming', and is used to generically mean working together. The technique of working together as a pair can vary, but there are typically 2 distinct roles. The first developer is called a *driver*. They will physically write all the code for the team. The second person is called a *navigator*, and may have the role of an observer, navigator, or a researcher. This person's responsibilities are to guide strategy, coming up with ideas for improvements and looking out for any issues that may arise in the code's design.

Traditionally, pairing is done on one computer system. However, the navigator in the following lessons will mostly function as a researcher. They will help to find commands and strategies that accomplish the lesson's needs. Thus, even though only the driver will be writing code, we will utilize both members' laptops.

## The Pairing Plan

This lesson and the one's that follow will pivot team member responsibilities in the middle its tasks. So, whomever starts as the driver in this project will switch and become the navigator where the lesson specifies. And vice versa.

So let's begin!
